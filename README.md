# Self-study notes

This repository serves as a collection of my self-study notes in various fields that interest me, typically in mathematics and computer science. My final goal is to have a sound understanding of math and language design so that I may create my own functional programming language some day.

## Topics:

* **Functional Programming** - following [Haskell Programming from First Principles](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Haskell_Programming_from_First_Principle.html?id=5FaXDAEACAAJ&redir_esc=y#:~:text=Haskell%20Programming%20makes%20Haskell%20as,is%20easier%20and%20works%20better.)

* **Set Theory** - following [Naive Set Theory](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Naive_Set_Theory/bWu9DgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)

* **Abstract Algebra** - following [A First Course in Abstract Algebra](https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/A_First_Course_in_Abstract_Algebra/7b5VwwEACAAJ?hl=en)

* **Category Theory** - following [Category Theory in Context](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Category_Theory_in_Context.html?id=6B9MDgAAQBAJ&redir_esc=y)
